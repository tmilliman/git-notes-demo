Some notes on using git.

Here are some notes on using git/github.  There are lots of resources out on the web for learning git.  So I haven't put much effort to explaining everything here.  This is just for getting started.  My notes from last meeting are [here]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Bhi3m3cPuNP_pHdzZib0VM2dgomyu9g/view?usp=sharing).  Here's another good link to an introduction to [Reproducible Research Version Control](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-version-control/).  Lesson 2 gives an introduction to using github to `fork` and `clone` a repo, make modifications and submit pull requests.
